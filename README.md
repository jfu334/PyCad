PyCad

# What is PyCad?

PyCad tries to be a complete CAD suite to be used from Python. 

It allows you to model objects in a similiar way to OpenSCAD, *with realtime preview*. 
Being based on Open CASCADE, it provides more powerful modelling techniques and is generally a lot faster. 

It supports you during the desing phase by providing different views on the models, just like traditional CAD systems do. 

Finally it allows you to integrate objects into a larger context.
